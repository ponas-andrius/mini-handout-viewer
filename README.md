# Front-end Task: Mini Handouts Viewer

Hi there!

We‚Äôd like to invite you to take on a front-end task that will help us understand how you structure UI, work with JSON data, and organize your code. The task should take no longer than 4‚Äì6 hours.

This is not about pixel-perfect details or spending days polishing ‚Äì we‚Äôre more interested in seeing how you think about component architecture, scalability, and sustainability.

## Task Goal

Build a mini handouts viewer that displays a list of steps from a JSON file and allows users to browse them interactively.

This task is inspired by the interactive handouts in our edtech platform ([see example](https://mano.vedliai.lt/lt/pratybos/RKSI?locale=lt)).

Context: In our platform, we use ProseMirror to power a custom rich-text editor. All exercise content is saved in JSON format, but you will not have to deal with that. The `steps.json` contains already transformed HTML snippets (summaryHtml and detailsHtml) which should be displayed in a clean and user-friendly way.

## Requirements

1. This task must be implemented using React.
2. Load step data from `steps.json` (provided).
3. Display one step at a time with its summary and details.
4. Allow users to mark steps as "completed" (e.g., a checkbox or visual indicator).
5. Use the provided `editor.css` as base styling (you can add additional styles if necessary).
6. Bonus: Accessibility. We know time is limited ‚Äì we don‚Äôt expect full accessibility support. Even small a11y considerations will give us great insights into how you think.

## Starter Files

We provide three starter files:

- **document.html**: Main HTML structure with a basic script to load JSON and render steps.
- **editor.css**: Base styles to make content look similar to our platform.
- **steps.json**: Step data with HTML snippets.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Clean and maintainable code structure
- Logical UI architecture (components, state management)
- User experience (UX)
- Bonus points for:
    - Responsive design
    - Accessibility support

## Submission

- Send us **a link to a Git repository**.
- Include instructions on how to run the project (e.g., npm install / build). If it‚Äôs static, it should run directly in a browser.
- Submit your results to [**rita@vedliai.lt**](mailto:rita@vedliai.lt)
